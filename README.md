# Spruce_UI_Automation

Practical task: UI Automation

**Statement**
A brand new online shop needs to know if its prices are competitive enough before
the site goes live. To perform this verification, they ask us to develop a test script
using WebDriverIO that scrapes some information from their main competitor.
The script should search for “product” using the top bar in
“https://mobile.x-cart.com/” and fetch the information from all the products within
the first 2 pages of the search results. The store expects the script to write the
results to a .txt file which will contain the following information about each article:
  ● The article name
  ● The article description
  ● The article price
  ● The article link (to be able to access the article page)
  
It is encouraged to:
  ● Create a new project framework
  ● The use of the Page object model
  ● Follow clean coding practices
  
**Test Steps:**
1) Go to the specified store page: https://mobile.x-cart.com/
2) Using the top bar search for “product”.
3) Scrape the information from all the results pages.
4) Generate the requested .txt file with the information from the results.
