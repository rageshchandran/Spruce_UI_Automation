ProductTitle: Avengers: Fabrikations Plush [Related Products]
Product Price: $14.99
Product description: [We've all seen it before. Sometimes when superheroes become established they go soft. They coast on their reputation, remembering past good deeds instead of undertaking new ones. But nobody would accuse the Avengers of such shenanigans - until now., They've all gone soft, or, well, at least some of the guys have. Choose Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, or Thor. Each of these Avengers: Age of Ultron Fabrikations soft-sculpt figures from Funko has only one point of articulation. Their heads turn, as if to say, "No, we have NOT gone soft. We have gone plushy. It's different." Take it from our tiny genius, billionaire, playboy, plushanthropist., Product Specifications  ]

ProductTitle: Legendary Hero 8-Bit Heart Bouquet
Product Price: $29.99
Product description: [Life was simpler in 8-bit. Sidescrolling was the name of the game and came with none of the potential motion-sickness that today's immersion games can cause. There were clear-cut good guys and bad guys. There was a princess to rescue. There was one hero, and it was you., And back in those days, Valentines were handmade from construction paper. Everybody got one. And when you wrote "love," it meant "love" as in "I'd love another cookie." Life was simpler., Do you have somebody in your life who deserves your heart... or three? Celebrate the simplicity of old-school gaming with our 8-bit Legendary Hero. This foam cutout comes with a cardboard fold-out stand or can be hung from the wall. Great as decoration on a table, it says, "Be my Player 2" better than any stupid flowers ever could., Product Specifications]

ProductTitle: Executive Building Brick Set (Chrome)
Product Price: $19.99
Product description: [We here at ThinkGeek World Domination HQ have long been of the philosophy that building bricks are for all ages, but some people seem to think they're just for kids.

Possibly before we get to the register. Slightly damp UPCs are still scannable, right?, Why should you stop having fun because some people have no imagination? You shouldn't! This Executive Building Brick Set is the perfect answer to those spoilsports. With 8 2x4 stud building bricks, this set can be incorporated with your other bricks to build all sorts of shiny custom creations.

ProductTitle: Blizzard Diablo Goblin Bank with Sound
Product Price: $29.99
Product description: [Diablo III's Treasure Goblins. Enigmatically, they're creatures which cannot deal damage to your character but are the most likely to be the reason for your character's untimely demise. There's something about them (could it be all the LOOT?!) that makes all reason go out the door. Even in hardcore, we occasionally accidentally chase them right into the midst of elite mob packs. That rarely ends well., You don't have to worry about that happening with this Diablo Treasure Goblin Bank with Sound, and we promise this one won't teleport out on you with 3% health left. He's going to stay right where you put him. Just don't put him down next to a portal, okay? Fill his bag with loot and listen to him cackle happily as he takes your money. And you don't have to beat the candy out of him to get your money back - there's a coin removal door on the bottom of the bank. If only in-game Treasure Goblins were this simple...., Product Specifications   ]

ProductTitle: Bright Idea - USB-Powered Light Bulb
Product Price: $11.99
Product description: [There are a lot of USB-powered devices that aren't terribly useful. See: USB Humping Dog, USB Pet Rock, USB Squirming Tentacle. They're all, shall we say, ornamental. Like rhinestones on a phone case, they're purely decorative additions to your space, which is just what you need sometimes., However, this USB-Powered Light Bulb won't ever fall into that category. See, when it's plugged into a USB port it gives off a frosted, soft blue light, and when it's not it glows in the dark., It's perfect for working late at night. Sure, your laptop is backlit, but sometimes it's not just the screen you need to see. And the shiny, adjustable cable is definitely artsy and clever. Plug it into an iGeek or a similar charger and have your own portable, crazy-looking lamp. It'd be great around a pool or at an outdoor venue where you need light for a little while but may not have a convenient outlet., Product Specifications]

ProductTitle: MJ Technology Android Tablet with Built-in HDTV Tuner
Product Price: $139.99
Product description: [Okay, so almost ANY ports is more than an iPad, so that isn't really an accomplishment, but we still figured it was worth pointing out, because we always end up frustrated when we end up troubleshooting someone's iPad (despite having bought them AppleCare and having previously escorted them to the Genius Bar) and realize we have to transfer something large we have on this laptop next to us to the iPad via the Internet. 

None of that with this new Android tablet with built-in HDTV tuner from MJ Technology. You might recognize MJ Technology's name because of the talk about their Ubuntu tablets coming out. This 7" one instead runs Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) on its 1.5GHz dual cortex A9 processor. To get a good grasp of this tablet, imagine everything you expect out of an Android tablet. Now add in the ability to pick up an over-the-air HDTV television signal. Voila. With just a 7" screen diagonal, it's not clunky but neither is it the torture of trying to navigate a spreadsheet on your phone. Goldilocks, we think it's just right.
